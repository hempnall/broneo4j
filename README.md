## Summary

Import bro logs into neo4j

## Usage

Assume ```bro_logs``` subdirectory contains various bro.log files

```
$ ./prepare_bro_logs_for_neo4j.sh 
$ neo4j-shell --file loadbro.cql
```
## Then..
Lots of pretty pictures

There must be better ways to prepare the bro log data for import into Neo4J - but that was not the point of this exercise
